# Testing Harness for the Expungement Generator


The Cucumber acceptance tests in this project run against instances of the [Expungement Generator](https://github.com/mhollander/Expungement-Generator).

While I may use these tests to make sure the Expungement Generator is working, you can use them to learn about how the generator is supposed to work.
